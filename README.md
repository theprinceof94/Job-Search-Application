# Job-Search-Application
This is a C# MVC application designed to be a platform for students to be able to interact with interviewers, and allows them to request and schedule interviews. Interviewers, when logged in, can accept or deny interview requests, and define available time slots for interviews. It is functional, but not aesthetically complete.
